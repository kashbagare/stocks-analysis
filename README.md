# stocks-analysis

## Overview of Project and Purpose
Use of Excel VBA skills to refactor code. The purpose of refactoring is to create a code that runs more efficiently which can speed up the process of data analysis. Use logic statements such as If-Then and For Loops as a way to sort through our data as well as arrays and various formatting elements.

When comparing the stock analyses of 2017 and 2018, it is very clear that 2017 was a much better year for ROI then 2018 because in 2017, all the tickers outside of TERP had a positive TREP. In 2018, almost all the tickers outside of ENPH and RUN has negative ROI. 

### Refactoring Results (2017)

The first image is the screenshot of the original code while the second image is the screenshot of the refactored code. When comparing the run time for the code from the original to the refactored version (2017 data), we can see that the refactored version ran quicker (0.09 seconds compared to 0.48 seconds)

### Refactoring Results (2018)

The first image is the screenshot of the original code while the second image is the screenshot of the refactored code. When comparing the run time for the code from the original to the refactored version (2018 data), we can see that the refactored version ran quicker (0.10 seconds compared to 0.48 seconds)

## Summary
- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

The biggest advantage of refactoring code is that runs more efficiently. More efficient code runs quicker and reduces the amount of resources required which creates a smoother data analysis process. The biggest negative of refactoring code is that it can be extremely time consuming. It can be quite hard to know how to approach refactoring because the solution may not be as intiutive and may require a lot of trial and error. 

-How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

In this case, the refactoring of the VBA script in this module was not as difficult because we were given the instructions and the code was extremely similar to the work completed earlier in the module. Because of this, the major hurdle in time consumption was not as big of an issue. I must also add that I have some experience in VBA so I was comfortable with using arrays (the refactoring process seemed more intiutive to me because of this). That being said, if we were asked to created another VBA script to manipulate the data in another way, that would have been a lot more difficult because we would have been starting with nothing.
